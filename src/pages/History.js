    <h2>Pre-Columbian Americas</h2>
    <p>Among Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European colonization, a number of nations had respected roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals; in some Indigenous communities, these social and spiritual roles are still observed
      .While the Indigenous cultures that preserve (or have adopted) these roles have their own names, in their own languages, for these individuals, a modern, pan-Indian term that some have adopted is "Two-Spirit".
       In a traditional culture that holds these roles as sacred, these individuals are recognized early in life, raised in the appropriate manner, learning from the Elders the customs, spiritual, and social duties fulfilled by these people in the community.
       While this new term has not been universally accepted—it has been criticized as a term of erasure by traditional communities who already have their own terms for the people being grouped under this new term, 
       and by those who reject what they call the "western" binary implications,
        such as implying that Natives believe these individuals are "both male and female"—it has generally received more acceptance and use than the anthropological term it replaced.

    <h2>India</h2>
    <p>
    Throughout Hindu and Vedic texts there are many descriptions of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender.
     There are several instances in ancient Indian epic poetry of same sex depictions and unions by gods and goddesses. There are several stories of depicting love between the same sex especially among kings and queens. 
     Kamasutra, the ancient Hinduism based Indian treatise on love talks about feelings for the same sex. There are several depictions of same-sex sexual acts in Hindu temples like Khajuraho. 
     Several Mughal noblemen and emperors and other Muslim rulers of South Asia are known to have had homosexual inclinations.

    <h2>Renaissance</h2>

    <img src={five} className="historyii"alt=''/>
    <p>The Renaissance saw intense oppression of homosexual relationships by the Roman Catholic Church. Homosexual activity radically passes from being completely legal in most of Europe to incurring the death penalty in most European states.'
        In France, first-offending sodomites lost their testicles, second offenders lost their penis, and third offenders were burned. Women caught in same-sex acts would be mutilated and executed as well.
        Thomas Aquinas argued that sodomy was second only to murder in the ranking of sins.The church used every means at its disposal to fight what it considered to be the "corruption of sodomy". 
        Men were fined or jailed; boys were flogged. The harshest punishments, such as burning at the stake, were usually reserved for crimes committed against the very young, or by violence. The Spanish Inquisition begins in 1480, sodomites were stoned, castrated, and burned.
         Between 1540 and 1700, more than 1,600 people were prosecuted for sodomy.In 1532 the Holy Roman Empire made sodomy punishable by death.The following year King Henry VIII passed the Buggery Act 1533 making all male-male sexual activity punishable by death.

    <h2>Early 20th century</h2>
    <p>The 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. 
        This was reflected in many of the films (see Pre-Code) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality.
         Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. 
        One of these songs had the title "Masculine Women, Feminine Men."</p>
        <p>
        By 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. Victorian values and morals, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s, became fashionable once again. During this period, life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period, and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to them.[150]

By the 1930s both fruit and fruitcake as well as numerous other words were seen as not only negative but also to mean male homosexual,although probably not universally.
 LGBT people were widely diagnosed as diseased with the potential for being cured, thus were regularly "treated" with castration,lobotomies, pudic nerve surgery,and electroshock treatment.
 So transferring the meaning of fruitcake, nutty, to someone who is deemed insane, or crazy, may have seemed rational at the time and many apparently believed that LGBT people were mentally unsound
  In the United States, psychiatric institutions ("mental hospitals") where many of these procedures were carried out were called fruitcake factories while in 1960s Australia they were called fruit factories.
